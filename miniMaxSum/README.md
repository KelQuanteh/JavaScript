## Description

This JavaScript program, `miniMaxSum`, calculates the minimum and maximum sums of 4 elements in an array. It does this by iterating through all possible combinations of 4 elements from the given array and keeping track of the minimum and maximum sums.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Git repository to your local machine.

2. Open the terminal and navigate to the repository's directory.

3. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

4. Run the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   node miniMaxSum.js
   ```

5. The program will calculate and display the minimum and maximum sums for the provided array.

## Code Explanation

- The code contains functions for summing an array, calculating combinations (although these are not used in the program), and swapping elements in an array.
- It calculates the total number of combinations, initializes counters and variables, and uses a while loop to iterate through the combinations.
- The program then swaps elements, calculates sums, and updates the minimum and maximum values accordingly.
- Finally, it logs the results to the console.
