# Debugging-JS
This JavaScript Debugging Repo on GitHub is a repository that contains a collection of code snippets or projects with debugging exercises for JavaScript developers. The repository aims to help developers improve their problem-solving skills by providing them with real-world scenarios to debug. Each debugging exercise typically includes a code snippet that has one or more bugs, along with a set of instructions to guide the developer in finding and fixing the bugs. The repository can be a useful resource for both beginner and experienced developers looking to hone their debugging skills. It can also serve as a platform for collaboration, where developers can submit their own debugging exercises or contribute to existing ones.
